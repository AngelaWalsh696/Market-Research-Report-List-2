<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pertussis Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Whole-cell Vaccines</li><li>Acellular Vaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pertussis vaccine market consists of two primary types: whole-cell vaccines and acellular vaccines. Whole-cell vaccines contain killed bacteria that induce a strong immune response, offering broader protection but can cause more side effects. In contrast, acellular vaccines use purified components of the bacteria, resulting in fewer adverse reactions while still providing effective immunity. The choice between these vaccine types depends on public health strategies, patient demographics, and the desired balance between efficacy and safety in preventing whooping cough.</p></p>
